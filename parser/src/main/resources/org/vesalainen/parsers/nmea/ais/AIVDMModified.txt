== Introduction ==

This is a description of how to decode AIVDM/AIVDO sentences.  It
collects and integrates information from publicly available sources
and is intended to assist developers of open-source software for
interpreting these messages.

AIVDM/AIVDO sentences are emitted by receivers for AIS, the marine
Automatic Identification System. AIS transmitters are fitted to
vessels, navigation markers, and certain types of shore station. They
periodically squawk their position (and course, when applicable), using
TDMA (Time Division Multiple Access) technology similar to the way
cellphones do to avoid mutual interference. AIS receivers make this data
available for navigation, anti-collision systems, and other uses.

The International Maritime Organization's (IMO) International
Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS) reqires operating AIS
transmitters on all international cargo vessels of more than 300 tons
displacement, all cargo vessels of more than 500 tons displacement,
and all passenger vessels; see <<SOLAS>> for details.  Individual
maritime nations may have stricter and more detailed rules: for those
obtaining in U.S. waters, see <<US-REQUIREMENTS>>.

AIS receivers report ASCII data packets as a byte stream over serial
or USB lines, using the NMEA 0183 or NMEA 2000 data formats. The RS422
variant of serial specified as a physical layer by NMEA 0183 is common
in marine navigation systems; there may be a "pilot plug"
<<PILOTPLUG>> which converts to USB. Alternatively, newer AIS
receivers may report directly over RS232 or USB.

AIS packets have the introducer "!AIVDM" or "!AIVDO"; AIVDM packets
are reports from other ships and AIVDO packets are reports from your
own ship.

A lengthy description of AIS, focusing on the goals and history of the
system, but not describing the data protocols in any detail, can be
found at <<AIS>>.

== Standards ==

Multiple standards bear on the AIVDM/AIVDO format.  This document
exists because assembling them into a complete picture is technically
difficult and was long impeded by legal barriers as well.

ITU Recommendation M.1371, "Technical Characteristics for a Universal
Shipborne Automatic Identification System Using Time Division Multiple
Access" <<ITU1371>>, issued in 2001, first described the bit-level
format of AIS radio messages. This standard was proprietary and
expensive when issued. I did not have access to it or any of its
followup revisions while assembling versions of this document up to
1.29.

ITU-R M.1371 was expanded and clarified by "IALA Technical
Clarifications on Recommendation ITU-R M.1371-1" <<IALA>>, which
is freely available.

There have been three minor revisions of ITU-R M.1371 since it was
originally issued.  These add interpretations to packet bitfields that
were previously marked "spare" and "regional reserved". ITU-R M.1371
revision 4 became available for free download, apparently at some
point in early 2011, well after most of this document was assembled.

The ASCII format for AIVDM/AIVDO representations of AIS radio messages
seems to have been set by IEC-PAS 61162-100, "Maritime navigation and
radiocommunication equipment and systems" <<IEC-PAS>>. It is
proprietary and I have not looked at it.  Various public sources
indicate that it has been "harmonized" with some version of NMEA 0183
<<NMEA>>, which I also have not looked at because it too is
proprietary and expensive, and surrounded by even more rapacious
attack lawyers.

== Information Sources ==

Together, the the IALA Technical Clarifications at <<IALA>> and the
Coast Guard's AIS pages at <<NAVCEN>> describe AIS message payloads
type 1-24 almost completely. Certain specialized binary messages of
types 6 and 8 defined by the International Maritime Organization are
described in <<IMO236>> and <<IMO289>>. The detail information on
payload formats in this document is mostly derived from these public
sources.

Kurt Schwehr is a research scientist at the Center for Coastal and
Ocean Mapping at the University of New Hamphire. Much of his research
involves AIS.  His work blog at <<Schwehr>> contains sample messages
and descriptions of AIS operation in the wild that shed light on
various obscure corners of the specification.  He has explained the
otherwise undocumented Repeat Indicator field and USCG extended AIVDM
to me by email. He also communicated some critical information from
<<IEC-PAS>>, and supplied information about new messages and fields in
ITU-1371-3.

Descriptions of messages 25 and 26 are based on AIS transceiver vendor
documentation was originally forwarded to me by a source wishing to
remain anonymous; I later checked them against ITU1371-4.  Message
type 27 was described in ITU1371-4 and added here after that became a
freely available download.

Should you set out to write a decoder using this document, you are
likely to find that one of your challenges is finding enough AIS
packet data to make an effective regression test -- especially if you
live out of line of sight of any ship traffic and would get nothing
from running an AIS receiver.  Fortunately, various AIS sites offer
live feeds over the Internet that aggregate AIS streams from all over
the world. Some charge subscriptions; others offer time-delayed access
for free and charge for a real-time feed. Still others are pool sites;
you join by contributing your feed and receive all feeds.

AIS Hub (<<AISHUB>>) is a free, public AIS feed pool. It provides
exchange of AIS data in raw NMEA format; all AISHub members share
their own received AIS data and receive the merged feed from all other
participating parties.  It is open-source friendly, offering a Linux
port in source of its software for collecting and forwarding AIS
data. Peter Stoyanov and the other AIS Hub principals have generously
donated a live feed to the GPSD project despite the fact that I live
60 miles inland and cannot send them anything interesting.

Some of what this document explains about the quirks of real-world
encoders comes from examples provided by Kurt Schwehr. Other such
information, especially for the less common sentences, comes from
inspection of sentences forwarded to me from AIS Hub by various
interested parties, and more recently from AIS Hub itself.

== Improving This Document ==

To avoid copyright difficulties, I rely only on freely redistributable
public documents and paraphrased reports from people who have seen the
relevant proprietary standards.  If you are such a person, please help
by reporting the following to be included in future versions of this
document:

* Sample sentences of types 16-17, 22-23, and 25-27.

* Sample sentences of type 6 and 8 conforming to <<IMO236>> and <<IMO289>>.

For verification purposes, I need the raw sentences together with
decoded dumps of their field values.  Please note that sample
sentences not accompanied by field dumps are *not* useful; I can get
plenty of those.

== Open-Source Implementations ==

The http://gpsd.berlios.de/[GPSD project] ships an AIVDM/AIVDO
sentence decoder as part of the daemon. This document was developed to
be the specification for it, and it will decode all sentence type
described herein.

The source-code repository of the GPSD project holds a conforming
standalone Python decoder, ais.py, that is not included in shipped
releases. It may be useful for developers working in that language.

<<Schwehr>> includes links to a collection of Python scripts for
decoding and analyzing AIVDM sentences.  Kurt Schwehr warns that this
is research code rather than a production tool.

There is a http://gnuais.sourceforge.net/[GNU AIS] project at
SourceForge.  It seems intended primarily to work directly
with AIS radios.

== AIVDM/AIVDO Sentence Layer ==

AIVDM/AIVDO is a two-layer protocol.  The outer layer is a variant of
NMEA 0183, the ancient standard for data interchange in marine
navigation systems; NMEA 0183 is described at <<NMEA>>.

Here is a typical AIVDM data packet:

--------------------------------------------------------------------
!AIVDM,1,1,,B,177KQJ5000G?tO`K>RA1wUbN0TKH,0*5C
--------------------------------------------------------------------

And here is what the fields mean:

Field 1, !AIVDM, identifies this as an AIVDM packet.

Field 2 (1 in this example) is the count of fragments in the currently
accumulating message.  The payload size of each sentence is limited by
NMEA 0183's 82-character maximum, so it is sometimes required to split
a payload over several fragment sentences.

Field 3 (1 in this example) is the fragment number of this
sentence. It will be one-based.  A sentence with a fragment count of
1 and a fragment number of 1 is complete in itself.

Field 4 (empty in this example) is a sequential message ID for
multi-sentence messages.

Field 5 (B in this example) is a radio channel code. AIS uses the high
side of the duplex from two VHF radio channels: AIS Channel A is
161.975Mhz (87B); AIS Channel B is 162.025Mhz (88B).

Field 6 (177KQJ5000G?tO`K>RA1wUbN0TKH in this example) is the data
payload. We'll describe how to decode this in later sections.

Field 7 (0) is the number of fill bits requires to pad the data
payload to a 6 bit boundary, ranging from 0 to 5.  Equivalently,
subtracting 5 from this tells how many least significant bits of the
last 6-bit nibble in the data payload should be ignored. Note that
this pad byte has a tricky interaction with the <<<ITU-1371>>>
requirement for byte alignment in over-the-air AIS messages; see the
detailed discussion of message lengths and alignment in a later
section.

The \*-separated suffix (\*5C) is the NMEA 0183 data-integrity checksum
for the sentence, preceded by "*".  It is computed on the entire
sentence including the AIVDM tag but excluding the leading "!".

For comparison, here is an example of a multifragment sentence with a
nonempty message ID field:

--------------------------------------------------------------------
!AIVDM,2,1,3,B,55P5TL01VIaAL@7WKO@mBplU@<PDhh000000001S;AJ::4A80?4i@E53,0*3E
!AIVDM,2,2,3,B,1@0000000000000,2*55
--------------------------------------------------------------------

== AIVDM/AIVDO Payload Armoring ==

The data payload is an ASCII-encoded bit vector.  Each character
represents six bits of data.  To recover the six bits, subtract 48
from the ASCII character value; if the result is greater than 40
subtract 8. According to <<IEC-PAS>>, the valid ASCII characters for
this encoding begin with "0" (64) and end with "w" (87); however, the
intermediate range "X" (58) to "\_" (95) is not used.

|======================================

Concatenate all six-bit quantities found in the payload, MSB first.
This is the binary payload of the sentence.  

== AIS Payload Data Types ==

Data in AIS message payloads (what you get after undoing the AIVDM/AIVDO
armoring) is encoded as bitfields in the sentence.  Bitfields may be
interpreted in one of the following ways:

- Signed or unsigned integer
- Float (scaled from signed integer)
- Flag or boolean
- Index into a controlled vocabulary
- Reserved bits
- Spare bits
- Strings

Numeric bitfields are interpreted as big-endian twos-complement
integers; when signed, the sign bit is the highest.  

Float fields have an associated divisor which should be applied
to convert to the correct units. In one case, the ROT field in message
types 1-3, the scaling operation involves a more laborate formula.

Flags are encoded as 1 for true/yes/on, 0 for false/no/off.

Indices into controlled vocabularies are numeric bitfields which
must be interpreted using per-field string lists specified in the
standards.

Spare fields generally seem to have been inserted in order to put
certain field starts on 8-bit boundaries, and should be ignored.  Decoders
should not, however, assume that spare fields will be all zeroes.

Reserved fields should not be ignored, as they may be assigned for
extension data in minor revisions of the AIS standard; it is noted in
the message descriptions where this has already occurred.  It is good
practice for a decoder to make reserved fields available to client
applications as uninterpreted bitfields.

Character-string fields within AIS messages are encoded in a special
way, referred to as "six-bit" in the tables below. First, chop the
string field into consecutive six-bit nibbles without padding (each
span of three 8-bit bytes includes 4 of these). Each six-bit nibble
maps to an ASCII character.  Nibbles 0-31 map to the characters "@" (
ASCII 64) through "\_" (ASCII 95) respectively; nibbles 32-63 map to
characters " " (ASCII 32) though "?"  (ASCII 63). Lowercase ASCII
letters, the backtick, right and left curly brackets, pipe bar, tilde
and DEL cannot be encoded.

|==========================================================================================

According to the standard, trailing unused characters in six-bit
fields will be represented by "@" (six-bit zero); however, real-world
encoders are not careful about this and often have nonzero garbage
after the "@". The terminating "@" should not be considered part of
the text, and any non-"@" characters after it should be discarded.  It
is also common to space-fill short fields such as ship and station
name, so a decoder should strip trailing spaces after stripping
at-signs and the garbage after them.

Trailing string fields are often specified as "up to" a certain number of bits.
Decoders should be prepared to handle any field length up to that
number, including zero.

== AIS Payload Interpretation ==

Note that many sources use 1-origin numbering for the bits.  We'll
use 0-origin in this document.

The first 6 bits of the payload (0-5) are the message type.  Message
types are as follows:

|======================================================

In normal operation, an AIS transceiver will broadcast a position report
(type 1, 2, or 3) every 2 to 10 seconds depending on the vessel's
speed while underway, and every 3 minutes while the vessel is at
anchor and stationary. It will send a type 5 identification every 6
minutes. (More detail is at <<IALA>>, part 2.3)

Class 6 is used for unencrypted structured extension messages by local
authorities such as the St. Lawrence Seaway and the U.S Coast Guard's 
PAWSS.  This document describes all of the Class 6 special message
formats approved for use in <<IMO236>> and <<IMO289>>.

Class 8 is in common use for private encrypted messages, such as
location transmission in military exercises. It is also used for
unencrypted structured extension messages by local authorities such as
the St. Lawrence Seaway and PAWSS. This document describes all of the
Class 8 special message formats approved for use in <<IMO236>> and
<<IMO289>>.

Classes 12 and 14 are used for text messaging, nominally safetty-related
but also for traffic control and occasionally chatter.

In practice, message types other than 1, 3, 4, 5, 18, and 24 are
unusual or rare; many AIS transmitters never emit them.  As of
November 2009, an overnight capture of a full feed from <<AISHUB>>
shows no type 25 or type 26 messages at all.

An MMSI is a Mobile Marine Service Identifier, a unique 9-digit ID for
the ship's radio(s).  The first three digits convey information about
the country in which the ID was issued <<ITU-MID>>.  US vessels
travelling solely in U.S. waters sometimes incorrectly omit the
leading "3", the geography code for North and Centra America and
Caribbean, emitting 8-digit MMSIs beginning with the U.S. country code
of 669.

Detailed descriptions of message types 1-24 follow. Message types 1-22
are derived from <<IALA>>. Message type 23 was decribed to me by Mike
Greene based on <<IEC-62287>>.  Message type 24 was described to me by
<<Schwehr>>, whose Python toolkit decodes it. Message types 25-26 are
reported by <<Schwehr>>, who observes they were added in Version 3 of
<<ITU1371>>. Message type 27 is direct from <<ITU1371>> version 4.

The "Member" column in these tables is not derived from any of the ITU
standards or amendments.  I have invented it in order to be able to
describe a lossless textual encoding of AIS sentences in JSON.  These
names are also chosen for suitability as structure/object member names
in computer languages, so that application programming interfaces
across different languages can have a common and readily intelligible
set to use.

The "T" column declares the data type of the field, and may have
any of the values in the following table.  It is intended to be used
for generating bitfield-extraction code directly from the message
type descriptions.

|==============================================================================
|u|   Unsigned integer
|U|   Unsigned integer with scale - renders as float, suffix is decimal places 
|i|   Signed integer
|I|   Signed integer with scale - renders as float, suffix is decimal places
|b|   Boolean
|e|   Enumerated type (controlled vocabulary)
|x|   Spare or reserved bit
|t|   String (packed six-bit ASCII)
|d|   Data (uninterpreted binary)
|a|   Array boundary, numeric suffix is maximum array size.
      ^ before suffix means preceding fields is the length. 
      Following fields are repeated to end of message
|==============================================================================

The field breakdowns in this document have been checked against live
decoded data rendered by known-good implementations for message types
1-15, 18-21, and 24.  Described but unchecked are 16-17, 22-23, and 
25-27. Also, the interpretation of IMO extension subtypes of messages
6 and 8 has yet to be tested. 

Bit lengths and length ranges are given because decoders should check
them against the message type. Messages with correct checksums but the
wrong payload length for their type occur with about 0.3% frequency on
AISHub; if you don't reject these, your clients will see spurious
zeros or garbage.

=== Types 1, 2 and 3: Position Report Class A ===

Type 1, 2 and 3 messages share a common reporting structure for
navigational information; we'll call it the Common Navigation Block
(CNB). This is the information most likely to be of interest for
decoding software. Total of 168 bits, occupying one AIVDM sentence.

The Repeat Indicator is a directive to an AIS transceiver that this
message should be rebroadcast.  This was intended as a way of getting
AIS messages around hills and other obstructions in coastal waters,
but is little used as base station coverage is more effective.  It is
intended that the bit be incremented on each retransmission, to a
maximum of three hops. A value of 3 indicates "Do not repeat".

Turn rate is encoded as follows:

* 0 = not turning
* 1...126 = turning right at up to 708 degrees per minute or higher
* 1...-126 = turning left at up to 708 degrees per minute or higher
* 127 = turning right at more than 5deg/30s (No TI available)
* -127 = turning left at more than 5deg/30s (No TI available)
* 128 (80 hex) indicates no turn information available (default)

Values between 0 and 708 degrees/min coded by ROT~AIS~=4.733 *
SQRT(ROT~sensor~) degrees/min where ROT~sensor~ is the Rate of Turn as
input by an external Rate of Turn Indicator. ROT~AIS~ is rounded to
the nearest integer value.  Thus, to decode the field value, divide by 4.733
and then square it. Sign of the field value should be preserved when
squaring it, otherwise the left/right indication will be lost.

Speed over ground is in 0.1-knot resolution from 0 to 102 knots.
value 1023 indicates speed is not available, value 1022 indicates
102.2 knots or higher.

The position accuracy flag indicates the accuracy of the fix.  A value of
1 indicates a DGPS-quality fix with an accuracy of < 10ms.  0, the
default, indicates an unaugmented GNSS fix with accuracy > 10m.

Longitude is given in in 1/10000 min; divide by 600000.0 to obtain
degrees. Values up to plus or minus 180 degrees, East = positive, West
\= negative.  A value of 181 degrees (0x6791AC0 hex) indicates that
longitude is not available and is the default.

Latitude is given in in 1/10000 min; divide by 600000.0 to obtain
degrees. Values up to plus or minus 90 degrees, North = positive,
South = negative. A value of 91 degrees (0x3412140 hex) indicates
latitude is not available and is the default.

Course over ground will be 3600 (0xE10) if that data is not available.

Seconds in UTC timestamp should be 0-59, except for these special values:

* 60 if time stamp is not available (default)
* 61 if positioning system is in manual input mode
* 62 if Electronic Position Fixing System operates in estimated (dead
     reckoning) mode,
* 63 if the positioning system is inoperative.

The Regional Reserved field is intended for use by local maritime
authorities.  It is not known to be in any actual use up to 2009.

The Maneuver Indicator (143-144) may have these values:

.Maneuver Indicator
[width="50%",frame="topbot",options="header"]
|===========================================================
|0 | Not available (default)
|1 | No special maneuver
|2 | Special maneuver (such as regional passing arrangement)
|===========================================================

The interpretation of bits 143-147 has been a bit unstable. In
<<IALA>>. and therefore in the original <<ITU1371>>, they were 
described like this:

[width="50%",frame="topbot",options="header"]
|=================================
|Field   |Len |Description
|143-145 | 3  |Regional Reserved
|146-147 | 2  |Spare
|=================================

The interpretation of 143-144 as a special maneuver field is new in
revision 3 of <<ITU1371>>.

The RAIM flag indicates whether Receiver Autonomous Integrity
Monitoring is being used to check the performance of the EPFD.
0 = RAIM not in use(default), 1 = RAIM in use.  See <<RAIM>> for
a detailed description of this flag.

Bits 149-167 are diagnostic information for the radio system.  Consult
<<IALA>> for detailed description of the latter.

=== Type 4: Base Station Report ===

This message is to be used by fixed-location base stations to
periodically report a position and time reference. Total of 168 bits, 
occupying one AIVDM sentence.

The standard uses "EPFD" to designate any Electronic Position Fixing Device.

Note: though values 9-15 are marked "not used" in <<IALA>>, the EPFD
type value 15 (all field bits 1) is not uncommon in the wild; it
appears some receivers emit it as the Undefined value. Decoders should
be prepared to accept this.

=== Type 5: Static and Voyage Related Data ===

Message has a total of 424 bits, occupying two AIVDM sentences.

In practice, the information in these fields (especially ETA and
destination) is not reliable, as it has to be hand-updated by
humans rather than gathered automatically from sensors.

Note that garbage values greater than 99 are supposed to be unused,
but are not uncommon in the wild; AIS transmitters seem prone to put
garbage in this field when it's not explicitly set.  Decoders should
treat these like value 0 rather than throwing an exception until and
unless the controlled vocabulary is extended to include the unknown
values.

=== Type 6: Binary Addressed Message ===

Message type 6 is an addressed point-to-point message with unspecified
binary payload.  The St. Lawrence Seaway AIS system and the USG PAWSS
system use this payload for local extension messages. <<IMO236>> and
<<IMO289>> describe payload use as international extension messages.
This type is variable in length up to a maximum of 1008 bits (up to 5
AIVDM sentence payloads).

|==============================================================================

Interpretation of the binary payload is controlled by:

* The Designated Area Code, which is a jurisdiction code: 366 for the 
  United States.  It uses the same encoding as the area designator in
  MMMSIs; see <<ITU-MID>>. 1 designates international (ITU) messages.

* The FID, which is the Functional ID for a message subtype.

The following is a non-exhaustive list of standardized DAC-FID pairs
in use for type 6.

DAC/FID pairs are assigned separately per message type.

A list of binary layouts for selected subtypes of message 6 follows.
(These are not yet implemented by GPSD.)

==== IMO236 Dangerous Cargo Indication ====

This message should be used as a response to a request for Dangerous
Cargo Indication from a competent authority. The message content is
used to identify the port where the documents for the dangerous goods
cargo can be found, e. g. last and next port of call, and to allow
the requesting authority to form a danger estimate.

A message 6 subtype. DAC = 001 FID = 12. Fixed length: 360 bits.
This is the <<IMO236>> version, now deprecated; there is a later 
<<IMO289>> version.

Note that though this is a message 6 subtype and described in
<<IMO236>> with the attribute "addressed", there is no destination
address.  A strikeout in <<IMO236>> suggests that this was originally
a subtype of 8.  It would be good defensive implementation for a
decoder to accept either.  Bit length may be used to distinguish them.

DAC/FID pairs are assigned separately per message type.  For St. Lawrence
Seaway messages, the DAC may be 316 (Canada) or 366 (U.S.) depending
on the transmitter location.

DAC/FID pairs 1/23, 1/28, and 1/30 have addressed versions descrubed
under type 6.

FID types 11-15 are being phased out and are not to be used after 1
Jan 2013.The deprecated IMO236 1/11 has a different binary layout from
the IMO289 1/31.  FID type 17 is in use; there is a proposed
update for it in <<IMO289>>.

Breakdowns of selected Message 8 subtypes from <<IMO289>> follow.
(These are not yet implemented by GPSD.)

==== Meteorological and Hydrological Data (IMO236) ===

A message 8 subtype. DAC = 001 FID = 11. Fixed length, 352 bits.
This is in use and described in <<IMO236>>, but has been deprecated by
<<289>> in favor of a message with the same title but FID = 31 and a
different binary layout. <<IMO236>> specifies a maximum interval between
broadcast of this message of 12 minutes.

<<IMO236>> says "If there is no data available, default value to be
transmitted is the highest available binary value for that particular
data field." aand no defaults are explicitly specified.  However, the
replacement FID=31 message has default values which do not obey this
rule. It would be good practice for a decoder to treat any
out-of-bounds value as N/A; the N/A formulas in the table above
reflect this.

<<IMO236>> gives the length of this message as 352, but lists only 336 
payload bits.

Water level is deviation from local chart datum and includes tide.

The waveheight field is labeled as "Significant" in <<IMO238>>, 
for whatever that means.

The seastate field has a note in <<IMO236>> reading "(manual input?)"?

The interpretation of the target identifier field depends on the
ppreceding type key.  For 0 and 1 it is a big-endian unsigned binary
integer (as shown above).  For type 2 and 3 it is 6-bit ASCII text. An
unknown target is expressed by type 3 and the string "@@@@@@@".

<<IMO289>> says: "When MMSI or IMO number is used, the least
significant bit should equal bit zero of the Target Identifier." It is
unclear how "bit zero" is to be interpreted, but it is not possible to

|==============================================================================

The "minute" entry actually only identifies the end of a 10-minute interval.

In <<IMO289>>, the Latitude formula is given as "Lat = (value / 100) – 9000".
This is incorrect; the decrement needs to be 90 for the range to be -90..+90.

Swell directions are arrival directions.

==== IMO289 Area Notice (broadcast) ====

This should be used to broadcast time- and location-dependent information about 
hazards to navigation.  For information-lifetime restrictions and usage 
guidance, refer to <<ITU1371>>.

The special value of 81.91 for air draught is probably a drafting
error in <<IMO289>>, as the scaled field does not have the precision
required to represent it. The actual special value is unknown.

The 2-bit _state fields describe the operational state of various sorts of
SOLAS-required navigational equipment.  GNSS systems may include GPS, Loran-C, or GLONASS. BNWAS is the Bridge Navigational Watch Alarm System.  THD is a

The lshiptype field uses Lloyd's Register STATCODE 5 encoding.

==== Meteorological and Hydrological Data (IMO289) ===

A message 8 subtype. DAC = 001 FID = 31. Fixed length, 360 bits.
Supersedes an <<IMO236>> message with the same title but FID = 11 and
a different binary layout.  The exact differences are: (a) The
addition of the Position Accuracy field, (b) water level has 12 bits
of precision rather than 9 (units of centimeters rather than
decimeters), and (c) end padding changes from 6 to 10 bits.

Altitude is in meters.  The special value 4095 indicates altitude is
not available; 4094 indicates 4094 meters or higher.

Speed over ground is in knots, not deciknots as in the common
navigation block; planes go faster. The special value 1023 indicates
speed not available, 1022 indicates 1022 knots or higher.

Position Accuracy, Longitude, Latitude, and Course over Ground
are encoded identically as in the common navigation block and
are even at the same bit offsets.  Time stamp has the same special

Pragmatic note: On <<<AISHUB>>> the actual content of these messages is
highly variable, ranging from fairly plain English ("PLEASE REPORT TO
JOBOURG TRAFFIC CHANNEL 13") through snippets of tabular data ("PAX
589 FG 36 IX 74 MOTO 10 CREW 108+1" through what look like opaque
commercial codes ("EP285 IX46 FG3 DK8 PL56") to empty strings and
content that looks like line noise ("]XFD5D/\7`>PA!Q DX0??K?8?>D"). 

Such apparently garbled content does *not* mean there is an error in
your decoder. It may indicate faulty encoders, operator error, or even
the use of private encodings for non-ASCII character sets.

=== Type 13: Safety-Related Acknowledgement ===

Message type 13 is a receipt acknowledgement to senders of
previous messages of type 12.  The message layout is identical to
a type 7 Binary Acknowledge.

=== Type 14: Safety-Related Broadcast Message ===

This is a broadcast text message.  The payload is interpreted as
six-bit text.  This message is variable in length up to a maximum of
1008 bits (up to 5 AIVDM sentence payloads).

applies to type 14 messages as well.

=== Type 15: Interrogation 1 ===

Message type 15 is used by a base station to query one or two other AIS
transceivers for status messages of specified types. "Source MMSI" is
the interrogating station.  88-160 bits depending on the number of queries.

This message is probably not interesting unless you are doing traffic
analysis of information flow in an AIS station network.  The "slot offset" 
members are a request for the response to interrogation to occupy
a particular time division in the TDMA packet layer.

|==============================================================================

There are four use cases for this message.  A decoder must dispatch on
the length of the data packet to determine which it is seeing:

1. One station is interrogated for one message type.  Length is 88 bits.

2. One station is interrogated for two message types, Length is 110
bits. There is a design error in the standard here; according to the
<<<ITU1371>>> requirement for padding to 8 bits, this should have been
112 with a 4-bit trailing spare field, and decoders should be prepared
to handle that length as well. See the discussion of byte alignment
elsewhere in this document for context.

3. Two stations are interrogated for one message type each. Length is
160 bits.  The second message type and second slot offset associated
with the first queried MMSI should be zeroed.

4. One station is interrogated for two message types, and a second for
one message type.  Length is 160 bits.

=== Type 16: Assignment Mode Command A ===

Message type 16 is used by a base station with control authority to
configure the scheduling of AIS informational messages from
subordinate stations, either as a frquency per 10-minute interval or
by specifying the TDMA slot(s) offset on which those messages should
be transmitted.  It is probably not of interest unless you are
studying the internal operation of an AIS base station network.
Length may be 96 or 144 bits.

|=============================================================================

If the message is 96 bits long, it should be interpreted as an
assignment for a single station (92 bits) followed by 4 bits of
padding reserved for future use. If the message is 144 bits long it
should be interpreted as a channel assignment for two stations; no
padding follows.

When increment is zero, the offset field is interpreted as the
frequency with which the subordinate station should report per
10-minute interval. When increment is nonzero, reporting interval
is specified at the level of TDMA slot numbers; see <<IALA>> for the 
detailed specification.

Note: While the 96-bit form of Type 16 is not uncommon, the 144-bit
form is extremely rare. As of March 2010 it has not been observed even
in long-duration samples from AISHub.

=== Type 17: DGNSS Broadcast Binary Message ===

Message type 17 is used to broadcast differential corrections for GPS.
The data in the payload is intended to be passed directly to GPS
receivers capable of accepting such corrections. 80 to 816 bits
depending on payload size.

Nore that latitude and longitude are in units of a tenth of a minute;
sign interpretation and out-of-band values are as in the Common
Navigation Clock.  (Note, however, that the hex representation of
the out-of-band values differs; it is 181 \* 60 \* 10 = 0x1a838 for
longitude, 91 \* 60 \* 10 = 0xd548 for latitude.)

The <<IALA>> description of the payload portion subfields has been
omitted, as it appears to be tied to the now obsolete RTCM2 protocol.

=== Type 18: Standard Class B CS Position Report ===

A less detailed report than types 1-3 for vessels using Class B
transmitters.  Omits navigational status and rate of turn.  Fields are
encoded as in the common navigation block.  168 bits total.

In <<IALA>> (and <<ITU1371>>) bits 141-145 were designated "Spare"; the
bit-flag semantics given here are from ITU-1371-3 and were
communicated by Kurt Schwehr.  Kurt warns that "the spec does not do a
good job of explaining these fields... I don't think that I totally
understand these fields."

|==============================================================================

The radio status is 20 bits rather than 19 because an extra first bit
selects whether it should be interpreted as a SOTDMA or ITDMA state.

=== Type 19: Extended Class B CS Position Report ===

A slightly more detailed report than type 18 for vessels using Class B
transmitters.  Omits navigational status and rate of turn.  Fields are
encoded as in the common navigation block and the Type 5 message.
Note that until just before the reserved field at bit 139 this is
identical to message 18.  312 bits total.

In practice, the information in the ship name and dimension fields is
not reliable, as it has to be hand-entered by humans rather than
gathered automatically from sensors.

According to <<IALA>>, the aid type field has values 1-15 for fixed
and 16-31 for floating aids to navigation.  The detailed list is as follows:

.Navaid Types
[frame="topbot",options="header"]
|====================================================================

|30   |Special Mark
|31   |Light Vessel / LANBY / Rigs
|====================================================================

The name field is up to 20 characters of 6-bit ASCII.  If this field
is full (has no trailing @ characters) the decoder should interpret
the Name Extension field later in the message (no more than 14 6-bit
characters) and concatenate it to this one to obtain the full name.

<<IALA>> describes bits 219-248 As "Dimension/Reference for Position",
implying that it is vessel dimensions as in message type 5.

The Off-Position Indicator is for floating Aids-to-Navigation only: 0
means on position; 1 means off position. Only valid if UTC second is equal to
or below 59.

The Virtual Aid flag is interpreted as follows: 0 = default = real Aid
to Navigation at indicated position; 1 = virtual Aid to
Navigation simulated by nearby AIS station.

If present, the Name Extension consists of packed six-bit ASCII
characters followed by 0-6 bits of padding to an 8-bit boundary. The
<<IALA>> description says "This parameter should be omitted when no
more than 20 characters for the name of the A-to-N are needed in
total. Only the required number of characters should be transmitted,
i.e. no @-character should be used."  A decoder can deduce the bit length
of the name extension field by subtracting 272 from the total message
bit length.

=== Type 22: Channel Management ===

This message is broadcast by a competent authority (an AIS network
control base station) to set VHF parameters for an AIS coverage
region.  Length is 168 bits.

This message contains no navigational information, and is unlikely to be of
interest unless you are implementing or studying an AIS base station
network.

122-138  |17  |SW Latitude      |sw_lat    |I1|SW latitude to 0.1 minutes

The values of the channel_a and channel_b fields are ITU frequency
designators for channelas A and B. Normally these will be 2087 and
2088, the AIS 1 and AIS 2 frequencies of 87B (161.975 MHz) and 88B
(162.025 MHz) respectively. Regional authorities may set different
frequencies.

The txrx field encodes the same information as the 2-bit field txrx
field in message type 23; only the two low bits are used.

The power bit instructs designated receivers which power level to use.

If the message is broadcast (addressed field is 0), the ne_lon,
ne_lat, sw_lon, and sw_lat fields are the corners of a rectangular
jurisdiction area over which control parameters are to be set.  If it
is addressed (addressed field is 1), the same span of data is
interpreted as two 30-bit MMSIs beginning at at bit offsets 69 and 104
respectively.

Yes, the addressed bit is *after* the fields it controls the
interpretation of.

Note that the 'not available' values for longitude and latitudes
match the short ones used in message 17, not the long ones used in the
common navigation block and elsewhere. 

The band fields control channel bandwidth for channels A and B, and
the zonesize field describes the size of the transition zone around the
control jurisdiction. The semantics of these fields are complicated,
controlling transmitter behavior as it moves between jurisdictions;
see <<IALA>> for full details.

=== Type 23: Group Assignment Command ===

This message is intended to be broadcast by a competent authority (an
AIS network-control base station) to set to set operational parameters
for all mobile stations in an AIS coverage region. Length is 160 bits.

This message contains no navigational information, and is unlikely to
be of interest unless you are implementing or studying an AIS base
station network.

The target set of mobile stations is specified by the station-type and
ship-type fields. An addressed (non-broadcast) message 22 overrides a
message 23, but a message 23 ovewrrides a broadcast message 22.

Note that the 'not available' values for longitude and latitudes
match the short ones used in messages 17 and 22, not the long ones
used in the common navigation block and elsewhere.

The txrx field tells the affected stations which channel or
channels they may transmit on.  The options refer to the same A and B
VHF channels as in Message Type 22. The field is interpreted as follows:

.Transmit Modes
[width="25%",frame="topbot"]
|===================================
|0 = |TxA/TxB, RxA/RxB (default)
|1 = |TxA, RxA/RxB
|2 = |TxB, RxA/RxB
|3 = |Reserved for Future Use
|===================================

.Station Types
[width="50%",frame="topbot"]
|======================================================
|0     |All types of mobiles (default)
|1     |Reserved for future use
|2     |All types of Class B mobile stations
|3     |SAR airborne mobile station
|4     |Aid to Navigation station
|5     |Class B shipborne mobile station (IEC62287 only)
|6-9   |Regional use and inland waterways
|10-15 |Reserved for future use
|======================================================

Reporting Interval is a 4 bit unsigned integer, how often to report
while within the area specified by this message. When the dual-channel
operation is suspended by Tx/Rx mode command 1 or 2, the reporting
interval is twice the interval given in the table.

.Station Intervals
[width="50%",frame="topbot"]
|======================================================
|0     |As given by the autonomous mode
|1     |10 Minutes
|2     |6 Minutes
|3     |3 Minutes
|4     |1 Minute
|5     |30 Seconds
|6     |15 Seconds
|7     |10 Seconds
|8     |5 Seconds
|9     |Next Shorter Reporting Interval
|10    |Next Longer Reporting Interval
|11-15 |Reserved for future use
|======================================================

Quiet Time is a 4 bit unsigned integer specifying how many minutes
affected stations are to remain silent. If a class B station receives
a quiet time command, it will continue to schedule nominal
transmission time periods, but is not to transmit message 18 or 24
during the quiet period.

=== Type 24: Static Data Report A ===

Equivalent of a Type 5 message for ships using Class B equipment.  Also
used to associate an MMSI with a name on either class A or class B equipment.

A"Type 24" may be in part A or part B format; either is 168 bits.
Parts A and B are expected to be broadcast in adjacent pairs.  The
interpretation of some fields in Type B format changes depending on
the range of the Type B MMSI field. 160 bits for part A, 168 bits for
part B.

<<IALA>> does not describe this message type; format information
is thanks to Kurt Schwehr.

If the Part Number field is 0, the rest of the message is interpreted
as a Part A; if it is 1, the rest of the message is interpreted
as a Part B; values 2 and 3 are not allowed.

The "Vendor ID" field is the name of the AIS equipment vendor.

Interpretation of the 30 bits 132-162 in Part B is variable. If the
MMSI at 8-37 is that of an auxiliary craft, the entry is taken to
refer to a small attached auxiliary vessel and these 30 bits are read
as the MMSI of the mother ship.  Otherwise the 30 bits describe vessel
dimensions as in Message Type 5.

According to <<MMSI>>, an MMSI is associated with an auxiliary craft
when it is of the form 98MIDXXXX where the digits 3, 4 and 5 represent
the MID and X is any figure from 0 to 9.

=== Type 24: Static Data Report B ===

Equivalent of a Type 5 message for ships using Class B equipment.  Also
used to associate an MMSI with a name on either class A or class B equipment.

A"Type 24" may be in part A or part B format; either is 168 bits.
Parts A and B are expected to be broadcast in adjacent pairs.  The
interpretation of some fields in Type B format changes depending on
the range of the Type B MMSI field. 160 bits for part A, 168 bits for
part B.

<<IALA>> does not describe this message type; format information
is thanks to Kurt Schwehr.

If the Part Number field is 0, the rest of the message is interpreted
as a Part A; if it is 1, the rest of the message is interpreted
as a Part B; values 2 and 3 are not allowed.

The "Vendor ID" field is the name of the AIS equipment vendor.

Interpretation of the 30 bits 132-162 in Part B is variable. If the
MMSI at 8-37 is that of an auxiliary craft, the entry is taken to
refer to a small attached auxiliary vessel and these 30 bits are read
as the MMSI of the mother ship.  Otherwise the 30 bits describe vessel
dimensions as in Message Type 5.

According to <<MMSI>>, an MMSI is associated with an auxiliary craft
when it is of the form 98MIDXXXX where the digits 3, 4 and 5 represent
the MID and X is any figure from 0 to 9.

=== Type 25: Single Slot Binary Message   ===

Maximum of 168 bits (a single slot). Fields after the Destination
MMSI are at variable offsets depending on that flag and the Destination
Indicator; they always occur in the same order but some may be omitted.

|===============================================================================

If the 'addressed' flag is on, 30 bits of data at offset 40 are
interpreted as a destination MMSI.  Otherwise that field span becomes 
part of the message payload, with the first 16 bits used as an
Application ID if the 'structured' flag is on.

If the 'structured' flag is on, a 16-bit application identifier is
extracted; this field is to be interpreted as a 10 bit DAC and 6-bit
FID as in message types 6 and 8.  Otherwise that field span becomes
part of the message payload.

The data fields are not, in contrast to message type 26, followed by a
radio status block.

Note: Type 25 is extremely rare. As of April 2011 it has not been
observed even in long-duration samples from AISHub.

=== Type 26: Multiple Slot Binary Message ===

Takes up 60-1064 bits (up to 5 slots).

|===============================================================================

The data field may span up to 5 256-bit slots in addition to the tail
end of the base slot.  The application_ID field, if present, is to be
interpreted as a 10 bit DAC and 6-bit FID as in message types 6 and 8.
Documentation says the data length of each slot is 224 and adds the
note "Allows for 32 bits of bit-stuffing."

The 20 radio status bits are always present after end-of-data in the
last slot and are in the format specified by <<IALA>>.  The radio
status is 20 bits rather than 19 because an extra first bit selects
whether it should be interpretred as a SOTDMA or ITDMA state.

Note: Type 26 is extremely rare. As of April 2011 it has not been
observed even in long-duration samples from AISHub.

=== Type 27: Long Range AIS Broadcast message  ===

ITU-1371-4 says this message is primarily intended for long-range
detection of AIS Class A equipped vessels (typically by
satellite). This message has a similar content to Messages 1, 2 and 3,
but the total number of bits has been compressed to allow for
increased propagation delays associated with long-range detection

== Local extensions ==

Some regional authorities extend the AIS message set.

The St. Lawrence Seaway broadcasts hydrological and lock-scheduling
messages using special encodings of the binary data of message types 6
and 8 (described in <<SEAWAY>>, freely available), and safety
information using types 12 and 14.  These message types are listed
under the description of type 8.

The U.S. Coast Guard has a system called PAWSS (Port and Water Safety
System) which uses extended AIS binary formats. <<SEAWAY>> says it's
intercompatible with the St. Lawrence Seaway system and describes three 
PAWSS-specific messages in its Appendix A.

<<IMO289>> standardizes some subtypes of messages 6 and 8 similar to
PAWSS messages for DAC 1, the unternational jurisdiction code. However,
in some cases identically named subtypes are assigned different FIDs.

=== U.S. Coast Guard Extended AIVDM ===

You may occasionally see AIVDM packets with additional comma-separated
fields following the CRC-32 checksum.  This is a semi-obsolescent
logging format used by the USCG, which has never documented it well
and plans to replace it with a new one based on NMEA 4.0.

Here's a sample sentence and field breakdown:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
!AIVDM,1,1,,B,15Cjtd0Oj;Jp7ilG7=UkKBoB0<06,0*63,s1234,d-119,T12.34567123,r003669958,1085889680
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Following the "*63" checksum are additional fields delimited by commas.  
These fields provide additional metadata about the reception of each AIS  
broadcast.

The field beginning with the lower case "s" is a Relative Signal  
Strength Indicator (RSSI) measurement from the receiver. This  
measurement has a range of 0-65535. This is one of the parameters used  
internally by the AIS receiver to determine the signal strength value as  
reported in the field beginning with the lower case "d". This field only  
exists when the AIS receiver provides this data.

The field beginning with a lower case "d" is the signal strength  
measurement for this broadcast in dBm. This field only exists when the  
AIS receiver provides this data.

The field beginning with the upper case "T" is the Time of Arrival  
of the received broadcast in seconds from UTC 0. This field only exists  
when the AIS receiver provides this data.

Another optional field not shown is one that begins with an upper  
case "S" and represents the slot number in which the reception occurred.  
The field would appear after the checksum and before the station  
identifier field. This field only exists when the AIS receiver provides  
this data. Example: S0042

The field beginning with the lower case "r" is a station identifier  
field. This field is always provided, regardless of the type of AIS  
equipment.  (Occasionally a base station identifier will be prefixed with
"b" instead.)

The last field is a time tag based on the standard C programming  
language time function. Both date and time to the nearest second can be  
derived from this field. This field is always provided, regardless of  
the type of AIS equipment.

== AIS Payload Byte Alignment, Padding, and Bit Stuffing ==

Warning: Here there be dragons. Read with care. Once you get through
it, you will at least not encounter anything more confusing in the
rest of this document.

=== Byte Alignment ===

AIS is a bit-sync protocol.  While some fields within AIS payloads are
8-bit-byte-aligned with preceding padding, most are not. Furthermore,
while most message variants have bit lengths that are a multiple of 8,
some do not.

<<ITU1371>> includes a single sentence, easy to miss, requiring
over-the-air messages to have trailing padding to a 8-bit boundary.
In most cases message lengths are a multiple of 8 with trailing spare
fields added to ensure this; thus, the requirement will not change the
transmitted bitlength of the message from what's described in the
standard. There are, however, two exceptions to this rule.

One is an apparent error in the format design.  The type 15 message
has a variant with 108 data bits and a trailing 2-bit spare field, for
110. This spare should have been 4 bits to guarantee a byte boundary
at 112 bits. Decoders need to be prepared to encounter this length
in case the transmitter has implemented the padding reqirement 
properly.

The other is messages containing variable-length text packed into
6-bit nibbles: types 6, 12, and 14.  They may have trailing padding
after the last nibble to get to an 8-bit boundary.  Decoders should
be prepared to encounter and ignore this.

The variable-length binary message types 8, 17, 25, and 26 are
constrained to have data payloads of a size such that the payload ends
on a byte boundary, but should not require special handling on this
account. The binary data in message types 8 and 17 is also guaranteed
to *begin* on a byte boundary, but this is not true of the addressed
variants of type 25 and 26.

=== Interaction with AIVDM padding ===

AIVDM armoring introduces a second layer of padding, with confusing
consequences.  The real payload, already padded to a bit length that
is a multiple of 8 by the AIS radio layer, gets armored as a sequence
of ASCII characters encoding 6-bit nibbles.  To capture all of it, the
payload must in effect be padded to the next multiple of 6.

Consider a type 12 message with 5 sixbit characters in it. These will
become bits 72-102 in the over-the-air message. The AIS radio layer will
pad that to 104 bits at transmission to get to an 8-bit boundary.  The
receiver, reporting the data in AIVDM armoring, will pad that to 108
bits to get to a 6-bit boundary, encode the result, and issue a pad
character of '4' to indicate that the low 4 bits of the last 6-bit
nibble should be ignored.

Because these requirements are tricky and poorly documented in the
official standards, receivers not uncommonly get them wrong.  The most
common way to get them wrong seems to be by computing the pad
character incorrectly.  

The most common error observed in the wild on AISHub is reporting a
pad 2 bits too small, making the message look like it is 2 bits longer
than it actually is.  This seems for some reason to be most common 
on Type 5 messages, which then decode as 426 bits rather than 424.

Accordingly, we recommend that when validating fixed-size messages by
type and bit-length, decoders should accept messages that are up to 5
bits over their theoretically correct length.

For messages with a variable-length trailing payload (6, 8, 12, 14,
17, 25, 26) there is no way to detect that the pad character might
be wrong.  If it is, this will manifest as truncation of the last
nibble or extra trailing zero data.

=== Bit Stuffing ===

The following probably will not affect decoders. Nevertheless we
document it here because it is just the sort of thing that is (a)
likely to confuse implementors reading the public portions of the
standards, and (b) all too likely to become visible if there are
firmware or software errors in the transmission chain.

There are references to "bit-stuffing" in the <<IALA>> clarifications
describing certain payload fields.  <<C2>> reveals the following in
3.2.2.1: "The bitstream is subject to bit stuffing. This means that if
more than 5 consecutive 1s are found in the output bit stream, a zero
is inserted. This applies to all bits except the databits of HDLC
flags."  <<IALA>> clarifies as follows: "On the transmitting side,
this means that if five (5) consecutive ones (1s) are found in the
output bit stream, a zero should be inserted after the five (5)
consecutive ones (1s). This applies to all bits between the HDLC flags
[...] On the receiving side, the first zero after five (5) consecutive
ones (1s) should be removed."

It appears that this bit stuffing is meant to be performed by the AIS
radio link layer at transmission time and undone at reception time,
and should not be visible in AIVDM payloads reported by the
receiver.  

== AIS feed sites ==

Most sites that advertise "live" AIS feeds actually give you a map
display through a browser.  Here are a few from which you can get raw
sentence data over a TCP/IP port for testing.  Coverage on these is
not yet very comprehensive; these sites tend to have good coverage in
Europe, the U.S. and a few ports in Asia but to be spotty elsewhere.
See their siting maps for details.

== JSON-AIS encoding ==

Here is an application of the JSON metaformat to present AIS data in a
form more convenient for application use than AIVDM/AIVDO sentences.
This encoding is implemented by GPSD and its client libraries.  It is
decribed here because (a) the specification is closely tied to the
field encodings, and (b) the author wishes to offer it as an
interoperability standard for other applications.

One previous effort, <<HAM-JSON-AIS>>, has been made to define a
JSON-based standard for exchange of unpacked, human-readable AIS
data. The latest version at time of writing, from December 2008,covers
only a small subset of the most common AIS messages, and many data
fields in the messages it does dump are omitted.  The member names
given in the bit-field tables match the attributes used in HAM-JSON-AIS
when HAM-JSON-AIS includes that field.

The general ground rules for JSON-AIS encoding are as follows:

1. Each sentence decodes to a JSON object.

2. When multiple kinds of JSON objects may occur in a data stream, AIS 
objects have the attribute "class":"AIS".

3. Some collections of fields aggregating to a timestamp are dumped in
ISO8601 format.

4. There are two variants of the encoding, one scaled and one
unscaled, which differ in the treatment of float and
controlled-vocabulary fields. An AIS-JSON object may have the optional
attribute "scaled":true to signify that the rest of its fields are
scaled; if this attribute has the value 'false' or is omitted, no
scaling has been performed.  Message types for which the unscaled and
scaled dumps will differ are 1-5, 9, 11, 17-19, 21-24, and 27.

5. In unscaled mode, float-valued fields are dumped in their unscaled
integer form. In scaled mode, division or other specified scaling is
applied and the value dumped as a float, *except* that certain extreme
or data-unavailable value as may be dumped as fixed strings; see the
table below.

6. In unscaled mode, the values of controlled-vocabulary fields are dumped as
integer indices.  In scaled mode, the values are dumped as strings.

This table does not include fields that are scaled by multipliers to integers.
These are reported in the multiplied form in both scaled and unscaled modes.

As the Beaufort scale is usually quoted numerically, conforming implementations
should do so rather than exoanding to its controlled vocabulary.

7. Trailung arrays are dumped as JSON subobject arrays.  The name of the 
array item is the name given in the 'a' table entry.  Explicit array count 
fields (presently "waycount" in Route Info messages") are not dumped.

8. In the VTS-Generated/Synthetic Targets message, the id field is
dumped as the value of an attribute the name of which is specified by
the idtype field.
